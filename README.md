# Method

I will be using the dot framework: library research and literature study

# Problem definition

The project requires for people to be able to login in order to leave a review. In this research report I am going to research the different ways in which to enable user to login, and the how secure each method is.

# Main question

### How do you use an identity provider?

## Sub questions

### What is an Identity provider?

An identity provider is a system creates, maintains and manages information and provides authentication. examples of such services are github, facebook, google and many more.

### What are the advantages of using an identity provider for security?

It is easy to implement and can be used for a variety of applications. Also as owner of the application you dont need to save user identity information, the users identity is seperate from the application. Also because of not saving user data you dont need to take security measures against bad actors atleast not for the login.

### How many providers deliver such a service?

Some examples are Auth0, github, google, facebook and twitter offer external login services in order to verify the identity.

### What is oAuth2?

Is a standard designed to allow a website or application to access resources hosted by other web apps on behalf of a user. oauth2 provides consent and restricts access on behalf of the user without ever sharing user credentials. There are different roles within oauth2: resource owner, client, resource server and authorization server.

### How does oAuth2 work

the Client must acquire its own credentials, a client id and client secret, from the Authorization Server in order to identify and authenticate itself when requesting an Access Token.

the steps in order to receive a token:

1.The Client requests authorization (authorization request) from the Authorization server, supplying the client id and secret to as identification; it also provides the scopes and an endpoint URI (redirect URI) to send the Access Token or the Authorization Code to.

2.The Authorization server authenticates the Client and verifies that the requested scopes are permitted.

3.The Resource owner interacts with the Authorization server to grant access.

4.The Authorization server redirects back to the Client with either an Authorization Code or Access Token, depending on the grant type, as it will be explained in the next section. A Refresh Token may also be returned.

5.With the Access Token, the Client requests access to the resource from the Resource server.

### What is a jwt token?

JSON web token is an open standard that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a json object. This information can be trusted and verified because it is digitally signed. Jwts can be signed using a secret or a public/private key.

###

### When should i use a web token?

Jwts are useful for authorization and information, authorization is the most common way for using a jwt. once the user is logged in every subsequent request will include a jwt allowing the user access to resources , services etc. Single sign on is a widely used feature that uses jwt.

For information exchange jwts are a good way of safely transmitting information between parties. Because jwts can be signed you can be sure the senders are who they say they are, you can also verify that the content inside of the header hasn&#39;t been tampered with.

### What is a json web token structure?

In its compact form JSON web tokens consist of three parts which are: Header, payload and signature.

The header typically exists of two parts the type of token and the signing algorithm used such as HMAC SHA256 or RSA.

example:

The second part of the jwt is the payload which contains the claims, claims are a statement about an entity and additional data. there are three types of claims: registered, public and private claims.

-Registered claims there are a set of predefined claims which are not mandatory but recommended to provide a set of useful interoperable claims, Some of them are: iss (issuer), exp (expiration time), sub (subject), aud (audience).

-Public claims These can be defined at will by those using JWTs. But to avoid collisions they should be defined in the IANA JSON Web Token Registry or be defined as a URI that contains a collision resistant namespace.

-Private claims These are the custom claims created to share information between parties that agree on using them and are neither registered or public claims.

example of the payload:

![](RackMultipart20220513-1-eutoye_html_63b58ca6056bd970.png)

And last is the signature to create this part you have to take the encoded header, the encoded payload, a secret and the algorithm specified in the header and sign it. The signature is used to verify the token wasn&#39;t changed along the way and in case of tokens signed with a private key, it can also verify that the sender of the jwt is who it says it is.

### How do JSON web tokens work?

In authentication when an user logs in successfully using their credentials a json web token will be returned.

# Conclusion

In conclusion there are many identity providers around, they carry alot of advantages opposed to not using one. oauth2 is the standard for external authentication and authorization. oauth 2 works in 5 steps:

1.The Client requests authorization (authorization request) from the Authorization server, supplying the client id and secret to as identification; it also provides the scopes and an endpoint URI (redirect URI) to send the Access Token or the Authorization Code to.

2.The Authorization server authenticates the Client and verifies that the requested scopes are permitted.

3.The Resource owner interacts with the Authorization server to grant access.

4.The Authorization server redirects back to the Client with either an Authorization Code or Access Token, depending on the grant type, as it will be explained in the next section. A Refresh Token may also be returned.

5.With the Access Token, the Client requests access to the resource from the Resource server.

The user will be verified within the app using a jwt (Jason web token) which will carry information about the user and information, jwt&#39;s can be signed with public or private keys so it know if the senders are who they say they are.
